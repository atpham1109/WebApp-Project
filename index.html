                <h3>Are humans really the weakest link in security?</h3>
                <h4>Social Engineering</h4>
                <p>You can spend all the money on purchase or update the best technical defense. But with some simple social engineering tricks,
                hackers still can get information from the employers. Technology cannot make mistakes, but humans can. That why humans are the weakest link in cybersecurity.
                <br> We should educate and gain our employers on social engineering. Training could cost a lot of money. However, people need to know
                how one click on that email link could cost the company millions of dollars. <br>In the end, technology exists to enhance people lives.
                We create more techs to make our lives easier. So, it is easy to understand that we are the creator of technology and also its weakest.
